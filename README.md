# Terminal Based FileExplorer

This project is basically to learn the use of system calls in operating system to create a simple file explorer with basic functionalities. It can work in two modes, one is where user can navigate across files and directories, open files along with moving back to previous state and forward to next state, just like arrow keys of any file structure. Users can also create/remove/move files and directories. User can create snapshot of the current structure to save it as checkpoint, in case he/she wants to revert to previous state of the system.
